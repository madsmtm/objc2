//! Metal has tools for validating that you're using it correctly, using these
//! is highly recommended! See [Apple's documentation on it][apple-doc], or
//! run `man MetalValidation` to get information on environment variables.

//! NOTE: To use [`MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice`] you need to link to
//! `CoreGraphics`, this can be done by using `objc2-core-graphics`, or by
//! doing:
//! ```rust
//! #[link(name = "CoreGraphics", kind = "framework")]
//! extern "C" {}
//! ```
//!
#![cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "MTLDevice"),
    doc = "[`MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice`]: #needs-MTLDevice-feature"
)]
//!
//! # Safety considerations
//!
//! Metal allows running arbitrary code on the GPU. We treat memory safety
//! issues on the GPU as just as unsafe as that which applies to the CPU. A
//! few notes on this below.
//!
//! ## Shaders
//!
//! Loading shaders (via `MTLLibrary`, function stitching etc.) is perfectly
//! safe, it is similar to dynamic linking. The restrictions that e.g.
//! `libloading::Library::new` labours under do not apply, since there are no
//! ctors in [the Metal Shading Language][msl-spec] (see section 4.2).
//!
//! Similarly, getting individual shaders (`MTLFunction`) is safe, we can
//! model this as the same as calling `dlsym` (which just returns a pointer).
//!
//! _Calling_ functions though, is not safe. Even though they can have their
//! parameter and return types checked at runtime, they may have additional
//! restrictions not present in the signature (e.g. `__builtin_unreachable()`
//! is possible in MSL, so is out-of-bounds accesses). If you view
//! `MTLFunction` as essentially just an `unsafe fn()` pointer, this should be
//! apparent.
//!
//! [msl-spec]: https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf
//!
//! ## Bounds checks
//!
//! It is yet unclear whether Metal APIs are bounds-checked on the CPU side or
//! not, so APIs that take offsets / lengths are often unsafe.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! TODO.
//!
//! ## Resource allocation and memory management
//!
//! TODO.
//!
//! ## Type safety
//!
//! TODO.
