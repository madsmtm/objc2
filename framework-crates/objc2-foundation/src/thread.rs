/// # Main Thread Checker
///
/// Xcode provides a tool called the ["Main Thread Checker"][mtc] which
/// verifies that UI APIs are being used from the correct thread. This is not
/// as principled as `MainThreadMarker`, but is helpful for catching mistakes.
///
/// You can use this tool on macOS by loading `libMainThreadChecker.dylib`
/// into your process using `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`:
///
/// ```console
/// DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/lib/libMainThreadChecker.dylib MTC_RESET_INSERT_LIBRARIES=0 cargo run
/// ```
///
/// If you're not running your binary through Cargo, you can omit
/// [`MTC_RESET_INSERT_LIBRARIES`][mtc-reset].
///
/// ```console
/// DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/lib/libMainThreadChecker.dylib target/debug/myapp
/// ```
///
/// If you're developing for iOS, you probably better off enabling the tool in
/// Xcode's own UI.
///
/// See [this excellent blog post][mtc-cfg] for details on further
/// configuration options.
///
/// [mtc]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-memory-thread-and-crash-issues-early#Detect-improper-UI-updates-on-background-threads
/// [mtc-reset]: https://bryce.co/main-thread-checker-configuration/#mtc_reset_insert_libraries
/// [mtc-cfg]: https://bryce.co/main-thread-checker-configuration/
///
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Use when designing APIs that are only safe to use on the main thread:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use objc2_foundation::{MainThreadMarker, NSObject};
/// use objc2::msg_send;
/// # let obj = 0 as *const NSObject;
///
/// // This action requires the main thread, so we take a marker as parameter.
/// // It signals clearly to users "this requires the main thread".
/// unsafe fn do_thing(obj: *const NSObject, _mtm: MainThreadMarker) {
///     msg_send![obj, someActionThatRequiresTheMainThread]
/// }
///
/// // Usage
///
/// // Create a new marker. This requires the `"NSThread"` feature.
/// // If that is not available, create the marker unsafely with
/// // `new_unchecked`, after having checked that the thread is the main one
/// // through other means.
