//! # Objective-C interface and runtime bindings
//!
//! Objective-C is<sup>1</sup> the standard programming language on Apple
//! platforms like macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS. It is an object-oriented
//! language centered around sending messages to it's instances, which is for
//! the most part equivalent to a function call.
//!
//! Most of the core libraries and frameworks that are in use on Apple systems
//! are written in Objective-C, and hence we would like the ability to
//! interract with these using Rust; this crate enables you to do that, in
//! as safe a manner as possible.
//!
//! <sup>1: Yes, I know, "was", Swift now exists. All the existing frameworks
//! are written in Objective-C though, so the point still holds.</sup>
//!
//!
//! ## Basic usage
//!
//! This example illustrates major parts of the functionality in this crate:
//!
//! First, we get a reference to the `NSObject`'s [`runtime::Class`] using the
//! [`class!`] macro.
//! Next, we creates a new [`runtime::Object`] pointer, and ensures it is
//! deallocated after we've used it by putting it into an [`rc::Owned`]
//! [`rc::Id`].
//! Now we send messages to the object to our hearts desire using
//! the [`msg_send!`] macro, and lastly, the `Id<Object, _>` goes out of
//! scope, and the object is deallocated.
//!
#![cfg_attr(apple, doc = "```")]
#![cfg_attr(not(apple), doc = "```no_run")]
//! use core::ptr::NonNull;
//! use objc2::{class, msg_send};
//! use objc2::ffi::NSUInteger;
//! use objc2::rc::{Id, Owned};
//! use objc2::runtime::{Bool, Object};
//!
//! // Creation
//! let cls = class!(NSObject);
//! let obj: *mut Object = unsafe { msg_send![cls, new] };
//! let obj = NonNull::new(obj).expect("Failed allocating object");
//! let obj: Id<Object, Owned> = unsafe { Id::new(obj) };
//!
//! // Usage
//! let hash: NSUInteger = unsafe { msg_send![obj, hash] };
//! let is_kind: Bool = unsafe { msg_send![obj, isKindOfClass: cls] };
//! assert!(is_kind.as_bool());
//! ```
//!
//! Note that this very simple example contains **a lot** of `unsafe` (which
//! should all ideally be justified with a `// SAFETY` comment). This is
//! required because our compiler can verify very little about the Objective-C
//! invocation, including all argument and return types used in [`msg_send!`];
//! we could have just as easily accidentally made `hash` an `f32`, or any
//! other type, and this would trigger undefined behaviour!
//!
//! Making the ergonomics better is something that is currently being worked
//! on, see e.g. the [`objc2-foundation`] crate for more ergonomic usage of at
//! least the `Foundation` framework.
//!
//! Anyhow, this nicely leads us to another feature that this crate has:
//!
//! [`runtime::Class`]: crate::runtime::Class
//! [`runtime::Object`]: crate::runtime::Object
//! [`rc::Owned`]: crate::rc::Owned
//! [`rc::Id`]: crate::rc::Id
//! [`objc2-foundation`]: https://crates.io/crates/objc2-foundation
//!
//!
//! ## Encodings and message type verification
//!
//! The Objective-C runtime includes encodings for each method that describe
//! the argument and return types. See the [`objc2-encode`] crate for the
//! full overview of what this is.
//!
//! The important part is, to make message sending _safer_ (not fully safe),
//! all arguments and return values for messages must implement [`Encode`].
//! This allows the Rust compiler to prevent you from passing e.g. a [`Box`]
//! into Objective-C, which would both be UB and leak the box.
//!
//! Furthermore, this crate can take advantage of the encodings provided by
//! the runtime to verify that the types used in Rust match the types encoded
//! for the method. This is not a perfect solution for ensuring safety of
//! message sends (some Rust types have the same encoding, but are not
//! equivalent), but it gets us much closer to it!
//!
//! To use this functionality, enable the `"verify_message"` cargo feature
//! while debugging. With this feature enabled, encoding types are checked
//! every time your send a message, and the message send will panic if they
//! are not equivalent.
//!
//! [`objc2-encode`]: https://crates.io/crates/objc2-encode
//! [`Box`]: std::boxed::Box
//!
//!
//! ## Crate features
//!
//! This crate exports several optional cargo features, see [`Cargo.toml`] for
//! an overview and description of these.
//!
//! [`Cargo.toml`]: https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/blob/master/objc2/Cargo.toml
//!
//!
//! ## Support for other Operating Systems
//!
//! The bindings can be used on Linux or *BSD utilizing the
//! [GNUstep Objective-C runtime](https://www.github.com/gnustep/libobjc2),
//! see the [`objc-sys`][`objc_sys`] crate for how to configure this.
//!
//!
//! ## Other features
//!
//! Anyhow, that was a quick introduction, this library also has [support for
//! handling exceptions][exc], [the ability to dynamically declare Objective-C
//! classes][declare], [more advanced reference-counting utilities][rc] and
//! more, peruse the documentation at will!
