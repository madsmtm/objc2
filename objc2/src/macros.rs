///
/// In general this is wildly `unsafe`, even more so than sending messages in
/// Objective-C, because this macro doesn't know the expected types and
/// because Rust has more safety invariants to uphold. Make sure to review the
/// safety section below.
///
/// The syntax is similar to the message syntax in Objective-C.
///
/// Variadic arguments are not currently supported.
///
/// [`MessageReceiver`]: crate::MessageReceiver
/// [`Message`]: crate::Message
/// [`rc::Id`]: crate::rc::Id
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the `catch_all` feature is enabled and the Objective-C method
/// throws an exception. Exceptions may however still cause UB until we get
/// `extern "C-unwind"`, see [RFC-2945].
///
/// And panics if the `verify_message` feature is enabled and the Objective-C
/// method's argument's encoding does not match the encoding of the given
/// arguments. This is highly recommended to enable while testing!
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The user must ensure that the selector is a valid method and is available
/// on the given receiver.
///
/// Since this macro can't inspect header files to see the expected types, it
/// is the users responsibility that the argument types and return type are
/// what the receiver excepts for this selector. A way of doing this is by
/// defining a wrapper function:
/// ```
/// # use std::os::raw::{c_int, c_char};
/// # use objc2::msg_send;
/// # use objc2::runtime::Object;
/// unsafe fn do_something(obj: &Object, arg: c_int) -> *const c_char {
///     msg_send![obj, doSomething: arg]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The user must also uphold any safety requirements (explicit and implicit)
/// that the method has (e.g. methods that take pointers as an argument
/// usually require that the pointer is valid and often non-null).
///
/// Additionally, the call must not violate Rust's mutability rules, e.g. if
/// passing an `&T` the Objective-C method must not mutate the variable.
///
/// If the receiver is a raw pointer the user must ensure that it is valid
/// (aligned, dereferenceable, initialized and so on). Messages to `null`
/// pointers are allowed (though discouraged), but only if the return type
/// itself is a pointer.
///
/// Finally, the method must not (yet, see [RFC-2945]) throw an exception.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use objc2::msg_send;
/// # use objc2::runtime::Object;
/// let obj: *mut Object;
/// # let obj: *mut Object = 0 as *mut Object;
/// let description: *const Object = unsafe { msg_send![obj, description] };
/// let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, setArg1: 1 arg2: 2] };
/// // Or with an optional comma between arguments:
/// let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, setArg1: 1, arg2: 2] };
/// ```
///
