//! # Objective-C type-encoding
//!
//! This is re-exported into the top level of `objc2`.
//!
//! The Objective-C directive `@encode` encodes types as strings, and this is
//! used in various places in the runtime.
//!
//! This crate provides the [`Encoding`] type to efficiently describe and
//! compare these type-encodings.
//!
//! Additionally it provides traits for annotating types that has an
//! Objective-C encoding: Specifically [`Encode`] for structs, [`RefEncode`]
//! for references and [`EncodeArguments`] for function arguments.
//!
//! This crate is exported under the [`objc2`] crate as `objc2::encode`, so
//! usually you would just use it from there.
//!
//! [`objc2`]: https://crates.io/crates/objc2
//!
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Implementing [`Encode`] and [`RefEncode`] for a custom type:
//!
//! ```
//! use objc2_encode::{Encode, Encoding, RefEncode};
//! // or from objc2:
//! // use objc2::{Encode, Encoding, RefEncode};
//!
//! #[repr(C)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     a: f32, // float
//!     b: i16, // int16_t
//! }
//!
//! unsafe impl Encode for MyStruct {
//!     const ENCODING: Encoding<'static> = Encoding::Struct(
//!         "MyStruct", // Must use the same name as defined in C header files
//!         &[
//!             f32::ENCODING, // Same as Encoding::Float
//!             i16::ENCODING, // Same as Encoding::Short
//!         ],
//!     );
//! }
//!
//! // @encode(MyStruct) -> "{MyStruct=fs}"
//! assert!(MyStruct::ENCODING.equivalent_to_str("{MyStruct=fs}"));
//!
//! unsafe impl RefEncode for MyStruct {
//!     // Note that if `MyStruct` is an Objective-C instance, this should
//!     // be `Encoding::Object`.
//!     const ENCODING_REF: Encoding<'static> = Encoding::Pointer(&Self::ENCODING);
//! }
//!
//! // @encode(MyStruct*) -> "^{MyStruct=fs}"
//! assert!(MyStruct::ENCODING_REF.equivalent_to_str("^{MyStruct=fs}"));
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`examples`] folder for more complex usage.
//!
//! [`examples`]: https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/tree/master/objc2-encode/examples
//!
//!
//! ## Caveats
//!
//! We've taken the pragmatic approach with [`Encode`] and [`RefEncode`], and
//! have implemented it for as many types as possible (instead of defining a
//! bunch of subtraits for very specific purposes). However, that might
//! sometimes be slightly surprising.
//!
//! Notably we have implemented these for [`bool`], which, in reality, you
//! would never actually see in an Objective-C method (they use `BOOL`, see
//! `objc2::runtime::Bool`), but which _can_ techincally occur, and as such
//! does make sense to define an encoding for.
//!
//! The other example is [`()`][`unit`], which doesn't make sense as a method
//! argument, but is a very common return type, and hence implements `Encode`.
//!
