# Security Policy

If you're looking to report a security vulnerability, please go to the GitHub [Security](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/security) tab, and click on the "Report a vulnerability" button.

Unsoundness issues should be limited to that which is actually exploitable; theoretical soundness issues should be reported by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/new), and is tracked with the label [I-unsound](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/labels/I-unsound).

Security issues inherent to Apple's frameworks should be reported to [Apple Security Research](https://security.apple.com/).

Note that I'm working on `objc2` in my free time, and am often without internet access. Security vulnerabilities will be highly prioritized, but expect delays for up to a week.
