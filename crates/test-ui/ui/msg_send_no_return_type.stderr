  |     unsafe { msg_send![cls, new] };
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type

  = note: cannot satisfy `_: ConvertReturn`
  = help: the trait `ConvertReturn` is implemented for `bool`
note: required by a bound in `MsgSend::send_message`
 --> $WORKSPACE/crates/objc2/src/__macro_helpers/msg_send.rs

  |     unsafe fn send_message<A, R>(self, sel: Sel, args: A) -> R
  |               ------------ required by a bound in this associated function
...

  |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `MsgSend::send_message`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__msg_send_helper` which comes from the expansion of the macro `msg_send` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
