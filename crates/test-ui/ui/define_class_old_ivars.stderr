error: the syntax for specifying instance variables has changed, move the ivars to a field in the struct instead
       #[ivars = i32] -> ivars: i32
 --> ui/define_class_old_ivars.rs

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__extract_attributes_inner` which comes from the expansion of the macro `define_class` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
