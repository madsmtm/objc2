error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> ui/msg_send_id_underspecified.rs

  |     let _: &Object = &*unsafe { msg_send_id![obj, description] };
  |                       ----------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-- type must be known at this point
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__msg_send_id_helper` which comes from the expansion of the macro `msg_send_id` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider giving `result` an explicit type
