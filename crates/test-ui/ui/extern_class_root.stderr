error[E0277]: the trait bound `MyObject: ClassType` is not satisfied
 --> ui/extern_class_root.rs

  | |     #[unsafe(super(MyObject))]

  | |_^ the trait `ClassType` is not implemented for `MyObject`

  = help: the following other types implement trait `ClassType`:
            MyRootClass
            NSObject
            __NSProxy
note: required by a bound in `ValidThreadKind::check`

...
  |     fn check() {}
  |        ----- required by a bound in this associated function
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__extern_class_inner` which comes from the expansion of the macro `extern_class` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
