  = note: expected trait object `dyn objc2::top_level_traits::MainThreadOnly`
             found trait object `(dyn objc2::top_level_traits::AllocAnyThread + 'static)`
  = help: `(dyn objc2::top_level_traits::AllocAnyThread + 'static)` implements `MainThreadOnly` so you could box the found value and coerce it to the trait object `Box<dyn MainThreadOnly>`, you will have to change the expected type as well
  = note: required for `NSObject` to implement `objc2::top_level_traits::MainThreadOnly`
  = note: required for `MainThreadMarker` to implement `From<&NSObject>`
