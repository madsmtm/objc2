error[E0382]: use of moved value: `obj`
 --> ui/msg_send_mutable.rs
  |
  |     let obj: &mut NSObject = unsafe { msg_send![cls, new] };
  |         --- move occurs because `obj` has type `&mut NSObject`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  |
  |     let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, selector] };
  |                                    --- value moved here
  |     // Could be solved with a reborrow
  |     let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, selector] };
  |                                    ^^^ value used here after move

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
