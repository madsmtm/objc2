error[E0382]: use of moved value: `obj`
 --> ui/msg_send_mutable.rs

  |     let obj: &mut Object = unsafe { msg_send![cls, new] };
  |         --- move occurs because `obj` has type `&mut objc2::runtime::Object`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

  |                                    --- value moved here
