Objective-C interface and runtime bindings in Rust.

Most of the core libraries and frameworks that are in use on Apple systems are
written in Objective-C; this crate enables you to interract with those.

This README is kept intentionally small in an effort to consolidate the
documentation, see [the Rust docs](https://docs.rs/objc2/) for more details.

This crate is part of the [`objc2` project](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2),
see that for related crates.
