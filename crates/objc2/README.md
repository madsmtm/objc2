Objective-C interface and bindings to the `Foundation` framework in Rust.

Most of the core libraries and frameworks that are in use on Apple systems are
written in Objective-C; this crate enables you to interract with those, and
provides ready-made bindings for the `Foundation` framework in particular.

## Example

```rust
use objc2::{class, msg_send, msg_send_id};
use objc2::ffi::NSUInteger;
use objc2::rc::{Id, Owned};
use objc2::runtime::Object;

let cls = class!(NSObject);
let obj: Id<Object, Owned> = unsafe { msg_send_id![cls, new] };

let hash: NSUInteger = unsafe { msg_send![&obj, hash] };
println!("NSObject hash: {}", hash);
```
