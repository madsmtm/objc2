/// A marker type that can be used to indicate that the object has been
/// allocated but not initialized.
///
/// The reason we use `Allocated<T>` / `Option<Allocated<T>>` instead of just
/// `*mut T` is:
/// - To allow releasing allocated objects, e.g. in the face of panics.
/// - To safely know the object is valid (albeit uninitialized).
///
/// Note that there is no way to specify ownership of allocated types, since
/// whether or not the allocated object is [`Owned`] or [`Shared`] is really
/// something to be determined _after_ you know which initializer it has been
/// called with.
///
/// For example, `+[NSMutableString alloc]` is allowed to return a non-unique
/// object as an optimization, and then only figure out afterwards whether it
/// needs to allocate, or if it can store an `NSString` internally.
/// Similarly, while e.g. `+[NSData alloc]` may return a unique object,
/// calling `-[NSData init]` afterwards could easily just return a shared
/// empty `NSData` instance.
///
/// [`Shared`]: super::Shared
/// [`Owned`]: super::Owned
