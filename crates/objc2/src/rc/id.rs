/// An pointer for Objective-C reference counted objects.
///
/// [`Id`] strongly references or "retains" the given object `T`, and
/// "releases" it again when dropped, thereby ensuring it will be deallocated
/// at the right time.
///
/// An [`Id`] can either be [`Owned`] or [`Shared`], represented with the `O`
/// type parameter.
///
/// If owned, it is guaranteed that there are no other references to the
/// object, and the [`Id`] can therefore be mutably dereferenced.
///
/// If shared, however, it can only be immutably dereferenced because there
/// may be other references to the object, since a shared [`Id`] can be cloned
/// to provide exactly that.
///
/// An [`Id<T, Owned>`] can be safely converted to a [`Id<T, Shared>`] using
/// [`Id::into_shared`] or `From`/`Into`. The opposite is not safely possible,
/// but the unsafe option [`Id::from_shared`] is provided.
///
/// `Option<Id<T, O>>` is guaranteed to have the same size as a pointer to the
/// object.
///
///
/// # Comparison to `std` types
///
/// `Id<T, Owned>` can be thought of as the Objective-C equivalent of [`Box`]
/// from the standard library: It is a unique pointer to some allocated
/// object, and that means you're allowed to get a mutable reference to it.
///
/// Likewise, `Id<T, Shared>` is the Objective-C equivalent of [`Arc`]: It is
/// a reference-counting pointer that, when cloned, increases the reference
/// count.
///
/// [`Box`]: alloc::boxed::Box
/// [`Arc`]: alloc::sync::Arc
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// If the inner type implements [`Drop`], that implementation will not be
/// called, since there is no way to ensure that the Objective-C runtime will
/// do so. If you need to run some code when the object is destroyed,
/// implement the `dealloc` method instead.
///
/// This allows `?Sized` types `T`, but the intention is to only support when
/// `T` is an `extern type` (yet unstable).
///
/// # Examples

/// ```no_run
/// use objc2::msg_send_id;
/// use objc2::runtime::{Class, Object};
/// use objc2::rc::{Id, Owned, Shared, WeakId};

/// // obj will be released when it goes out of scope
///
/// // share the object so we can clone it
/// let obj: Id<_, Shared> = obj.into();
/// let another_ref = obj.clone();
/// // dropping our other reference will decrement the retain count
/// drop(another_ref);
///
/// let weak = WeakId::new(&obj);
