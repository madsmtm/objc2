# About the generated framework crates

The `objc2` project provides (mostly) autogenerated interfaces to Apple's
Objective-C frameworks like AppKit, Foundation, Metal, WebKit, and so on.

The bindings currently contain very little documentation, you should view
[Apple's developer documentation][apple-doc-index] for detailed
information about each API. (There are [plans][#309] for importing that
documentation here).

These crates uses `objc2` to declare the external interface to the
Objective-C classes and protocols. It is highly recommended that you read
the documentation here for details on how the Objective-C interop works.

They also use `block2::Block` in the public API, check out the documentation
for the [`block2`] crate for how to call such methods using a closure.
