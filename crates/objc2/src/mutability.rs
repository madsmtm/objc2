//! # Marker types for class mutability.
//!
//! Every class must indicate which kind of mutability its instances use:
//! - Is the instance mutable or immutable?
//! - Does it use interior mutability (mutable behind `&self`, like
//!   [`UnsafeCell`])?
//! - Does it access global statics in such a way that the type is only safe
//!   to use from the main thread?
//!
//! The answer to these facts influence the final capabilities the type has,
//! as encoded in [the traits in this module](#traits).
//!
//! Concretely, you set [`ClassType::Mutability`] to [one of the types in this
//! module](#structs) to indicate the properties of class you're dealing with
//! (can be done inside [`extern_class!`] and [`declare_class!`]).
//!
//! Note that precious little of Objective-C follows Rust's usual shared xor
//! unique ownership model, most often objects assume interior mutability.
//!
//! [`UnsafeCell`]: core::cell::UnsafeCell
//! [`ClassType::Mutability`]: crate::ClassType::Mutability
//! [`extern_class!`]: crate::extern_class
//! [`declare_class!`]: crate::declare_class
//!
//!
//! # SemVer
//!
//! It is considered a major change to change the [`ClassType::Mutability`] of
//! an object, though it can be done as a minor change in some cases to fix a
//! bug.
