// Foundation collection types store their items in such a way that they can
// give out references to their data without having to autorelease it first:
// <https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW12>
//
// Hence functions can safely return references that are not bound to a pool
// (provided they are not modified outside `&mut`, which we implement them not
// to be).
//
